# Kubernetes Cluster Setup with Kubeadm

Kubeadm is an excellent tool to set up a working Kubernetes cluster in less time. It does all the heavy lifting in terms of setting up all Kubernetes cluster components and follows best practices for cluster configuration.

---

## 📌 What is Kubeadm?

`kubeadm` is a tool to bootstrap a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster without complex configuration. It simplifies the process by running a series of prechecks to ensure the server has all the essential components and configurations to run Kubernetes.

It is developed and maintained by the official Kubernetes community.  
Other options like **Minikube** or **Kind** are easier to set up and are good for lightweight testing. However, if you want to experiment with cluster components or test utilities related to cluster administration, **Kubeadm** is the best option. It allows you to create a production‑like cluster locally or on cloud VMs for development and testing.

## 🖥️ Prerequisites for Azure VM Setup

Before bootstrapping Kubernetes with Kubeadm, ensure the following:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy) recommended  
- **Master Node**: 2 CPUs, 4 GB RAM minimum  
- **Worker Nodes**: 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM minimum  
- **Networking**:  
  - All nodes must be on the same virtual network  
  - Ensure DNS resolution between nodes

# Step-by-Step Services for Kubernetes Cluster Setup

Tomorrow’s plan is to provision the infrastructure and bring up the essential services required for a Kubernetes cluster. Follow this sequence:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**  
   - Provision Azure VMs (master + workers).  
   - Configure networking (VNet, subnet, NSG rules).  
   - Ensure DNS resolution and private IP connectivity.  

2. **System Preparation**  
   - Disable swap on all nodes.  
   - Load kernel modules (`overlay`, `br_netfilter`).  
   - Apply sysctl parameters for IP forwarding and bridge traffic.  

3. **Container Runtime**  
   - Install and configure `containerd`.  
   - Enable `SystemdCgroup` in `/etc/containerd/config.toml`.  
   - Start and enable the `containerd` service.  

4. **Kubernetes Binaries**  
   - Add Kubernetes apt repository.  
   - Install `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl`.  
   - Hold versions to prevent accidental upgrades.  

5. **Bootstrap Master Node**  
   - Run `kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`.  
   - Configure `kubectl` for your user.  
   - Deploy a CNI plugin (Calico recommended).  

6. **Join Worker Nodes**  
   - Use the `kubeadm join` command generated by the master.  
   - Verify connectivity and readiness with `kubectl get nodes`.  

7. **Cluster Validation**  
   - Deploy a test workload (e.g., Nginx Pod + Service).  
   - Confirm pod scheduling across nodes.  
   - Test NodePort or ClusterIP service reachability.
